# Resume Fraud Detection System - Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a Python-based resume fraud detection system that identifies potential signs of fraudulent or malicious candidates during the hiring process. This system should analyze resumes and associated candidate information to flag suspicious patterns, inconsistencies, and red flags.

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive solution that combines multiple detection techniques to identify:
- Fraudulent contact information and identity markers
- AI-generated content in resumes
- Discrepancies between claimed experience and publicly available information
- Other indicators of potential malicious intent or misrepresentation

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

Your solution must implement **at least 2** of the following detection mechanisms:

#### 1. Contact Information Verification
- Validate phone numbers, email addresses, and other contact details
- Check for disposable/temporary email services
- Analyze geographic consistency of phone numbers and addresses
- **Suggested Tools**: IPQS API, Abstract API, or similar fraud detection services

#### 2. AI Content Detection
- Identify sections of resumes that may have been generated using AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.)
- Analyze writing patterns, style consistency, and linguistic markers
- **Suggested Tools**: OpenAI's detection tools, custom ML models, or third-party AI detection APIs

#### 3. Professional Background Verification
- Cross-reference claimed employment history with publicly available information
- Verify educational credentials against institution databases
- Check for consistency in professional timeline and career progression
- **Suggested Tools**: LinkedIn scraping, company websites, educational institution APIs

#### 4. Digital Footprint Analysis
- Search for online presence and cross-reference with resume claims
- Identify suspicious social media profiles or lack thereof
- Analyze consistency between online persona and professional claims
- **Suggested Tools**: Social media APIs, search engines, professional networking sites

#### 5. Document Authenticity
- Analyze resume formatting and metadata for signs of template abuse
- Check for common fraudulent resume patterns
- Validate document creation timestamps and modification history

### Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Input**: Accept resume files in common formats (PDF, DOCX)
- **Output**: Structured fraud risk assessment with confidence scores
- **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions and API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and edge cases

### Deliverables

1. **Working Code**
   - Complete Python implementation
   - Requirements.txt or poetry.lock file
   - Configuration files for API keys and settings

2. **Setup Instructions**
   - Clear installation and configuration steps
   - Example usage commands
   - Sample input/output demonstrations

3. **Documentation**
   - Technical architecture overview
   - Detailed explanation of detection algorithms
   - Rationale for chosen tools and approaches
   - Known limitations and potential improvements

4. **Analysis Report**
   - Summary of implemented features
   - Effectiveness assessment of each detection method
   - Discussion of false positive/negative considerations
   - Recommendations for production deployment

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Privacy & Ethics**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- **Honor System**: Work independently; collaboration is not permitted


## Getting Started

1. Fork or download this repository
2. Set up your development environment
3. Review the requirements and plan your approach
4. Begin implementation with your chosen detection methods
5. Document your process and findings as you work

## Questions?

I'm more than happy to help! Feel free to reach out to Paul at paul@validia.ai with any questions or clarifications needed.

## Additional Notes

- Consider rate limiting when working with external APIs
- Implement appropriate caching mechanisms for efficiency
- Think about how this system would scale in production
- Balance detection accuracy with processing speed
- Consider the user experience for both legitimate and flagged candidates
